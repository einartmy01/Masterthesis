- Evaluates latency by performance, (human) IRL

Test of human factors and realiable communcations via 5g
"Limited literature on:" 
"Positive effect of bitrate on quaility", "Stalling has worse effect on QoExperience, if bitrate is higher"
"Higher frame rate not linked to information assimiliation, but increased user enjoyment"

Tested with three different levels of bitrate
1, 6, 24 Mbps
5, 15, 25 FPS
Stimulus
Light signal, Distance marker

MeasurementsResponce accuracyResponce speed

Study 1:
Higher bitrate -> faster answears, more correct
Higher FPS -> same speed on answear, same amount of correct
Study 2:
Higher bitrate -> same speed on answears, more correct
Higher FPS -> same speed on answear, same amount of correct

Bitrate is more important (source 5 in PP: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2072298.2072351)
Stimulus type:
Distance marker signs where answeared faster and more correct than light signals
5000 -> 3000 speed, and 0.51 -> 0.58 and 0.61 -> 0.69

This is promosing new with the implementation of ERTMS as the only input stimulus in signalling threw camera and video stream will be signs as the remote control operatior will get the ETCS directly in the control room. 
After certain bitrate less helpful

- Evaluate latency on performance, (Humans) Sim
To study QoE. 
- VR.
- 270 angle HMD video threw 4 cameras on crane.
- Joystick, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 -> 80, 90, 100, 130, 180, 280, 480, 880

Comfort of the subject was not affected by joystick delay, but the display delayed had an negative effect of Comfort quality. Why this could be discussed alot. Might have to do with VR and a more moving image.
